<!-- Past Project -->
<section>
  <h2>Past Project: ColonyMate App</h2>
  <p>Before Quickport CRM, we developed <strong>ColonyMate</strong> — a micro Android app to help gated community track Buses and other features. It was piloted successfully in a colony located in Mumbai in 2025 via direct APK distribution.</p>
  <p>This project helped us understand grassroots needs, mobile simplicity, and WhatsApp-based communication patterns — now used in Quickport CRM.</p>
